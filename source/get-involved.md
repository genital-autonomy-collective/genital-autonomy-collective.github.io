# Get Involved

At the Genital Autonomy Collective (GAC), we believe that challenging hierarchical systems of power is necessary for meaningful change.  Therefore we center radical kindness, grassroots action, and mutual aid.  Everyone has a role in creating a future of intersectional genital autonomy, whether you’re showing up for a protest, helping moderate a space, or organizing within your own communities.  GAC is here to reduce barriers and support your efforts along the way.  
That said, we’d still love your support!

Sign up for our coming newsletter or follow the #announcements channels in our Discords for the latest volunteer opportunities.   To be notified directly, grab the `@activism event notifications` role in #roles on our Discord.

##  Support Us Financially

Even a small donation helps us fund support groups, educational materials, research, and outreach at events like Pride.  Once our basic needs are met, additional funds go toward other Genital Autonomy organization’s broader legal advocacy efforts, such as Intact Global’s Hadachek v. Oregon.

**[Donate Now](https://tinyurl.com/supportGAC)**

<!--Will move to: https://autonomycollective.org/donate--> 

Your support helps keep GAC community-driven. Rather than chasing foundation grants that often come with strings attached, we rely on grassroots contributions that allow us to stay accountable to people. Whenever possible, we prioritize working with small, local businesses, because building community means investing in it directly.

> “I personally do not want to beholden to grant funding because foundation grants are a part of the system that rich people can say what human rights are worth fighting for and how.  They slow down the process and bring in unnecessary bureaucracy which gets in the way of people, our members, not just the non-profit industrial complex board members directly building community.  I believe we can do that with small individual and voluntary member donations directly from our communities, and not strive for unsustainable infinite growth that society has ingrained in us as the only way forward.” - Alliana Arshad, Founder of the Genital Autonomy Collective

## Discord Community Servers
###  Bump to Boost Visibility 

One of the easiest and *most impactful* ways to support is to go to the `#bot-commands` channel in our Discord servers and type: `/bump`

Then select the **Disboard /bump** command. That simple action helps Genital Autonomy Collective show up on Disboard's server listings and has brought many people to our community.  As well as getting more eyes on the issue even if they don’t join.

You don’t have to be active all the time to make a big difference, just bumping when you remember helps get our message in front of eyes that need it.

### Boost Our Discord Servers

If you have Discord Nitro, you get free monthly server boosts, and using one to support our server is an easy, meaningful way to help! 

I’m personally not a fan of proprietary platforms locking community features behind paywalls, but if you already have Nitro, this is a great way to increase visibility for intersectional genital autonomy.

Server boosting helps us:
- Add a **server banner** for visibility in partner and discovery listings  
- Unlock **more emoji slots**, allowing accessibility, identity, and location-based emojis  
- Improve **audio/video quality** for support groups and virtual events

Boosts are cumulative, and every level unlocks more features for our community.

Learn more about how server boosting works in [Discord’s Server Boosting FAQ](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028038352-Server-Boosting-FAQ).

## Printables to Share In Person

One of the most accessible ways to spread awareness is through print media. We’ve created **stickers, flyers, zines, and info cards** that you can print and distribute in your local area.  Printing these on shipping label paper is an incredibly easy and cheap way to make stickers.  
<!--insert shipping label paper image https://i.imgur.com/MKIudb9.jpeg-->

You can find everything on our [Printables Page](https://autonomycollective.org/resources/printables).

### What to Print:
- **Intact Care Stickers** – Simple short care guides for parents to prevent forced retraction
- **GAC Flyers** – Spread awareness of our support groups, research, and advocacy
- **Zines** – Short, accessible reads on intersectional genital autonomy
- **Mini Info Cards** – Easy to tuck into books, envelopes, or handouts

### Where to Place (With Permission):
- Changing stations in restrooms
- Waiting rooms in pediatric, OB/GYN, or family clinics
- Inside childcare and parenting books at Little Free Libraries or bookstores
- Bulletin boards in queer centers, campuses, cafés, clinics, or other community spaces
- Bathroom stalls at community events or clubs

>  **Please respect public and private property. Only post materials where you have permission.**

Even small placements can lead someone to discover vital support and resources.

### Academics and Researchers
GAC is looking for more opportunities to bring intersectional genital autonomy into academic spheres.  If you have connections with a journal willing to publish in support of genital autonomy many of our members are willing to write or otherwise get involved. 
### Writers
Help us write educational content for our website, print media, blog posts & announcements, etc. 
### Organizational Collaborations
We’re always looking to build connections with like-minded organizations, collectives, and grassroots efforts. Whether it’s co-hosting events, sharing resources, or amplifying each other’s work, collaboration helps us grow stronger together.
If your group’s values align with intersectional genital autonomy, we’d love to connect. Let’s explore how we can support each other through shared advocacy, education, and outreach.



###  Community Moderators
Help keep our online spaces safe, supportive, and aligned with our mission. Moderators welcome new members, enforce community guidelines, and guide discussions in a respectful, inclusive direction. 
We’re primarily seeking Discord moderators but also welcome help with expanding to other community platforms such as Facebook Groups. 
Becoming a moderator requires being a trusted, active community member first. We’re looking for people who know our values, model respectful engagement, and can help others feel heard and supported.  See #Mod-Guidelines or https://autonomycollective.org/codeofconduct/modguidelines for more details.
### Peer Support Group Facilitators

Support others by helping lead our online support groups with compassion and care. Facilitators help set a welcoming tone, guide respectful conversation, and ensure that everyone has space to share and feel heard.
You don’t need to be a therapist, just someone with lived experience, empathy, and a strong understanding of our values.  Facilitators are usually longtime or trusted members of the community who can hold space with sensitivity and maintain group boundaries.  See our group norms and guidelines for more information.
