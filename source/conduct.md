title: Code of Conduct
---

**The absence of a specific rule or guideline is not grounds to excuse, justify, or persist harmful behavior.** If you are told that something you are doing is harmful, take a step back. Even a "might be" is grounds to give it some thought. We will continue to shape the rules to help maintain a safe and reasonably comfortable environment.

## Our Pledge
We as members pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.


- **Due to the nature of the topics, you must be 18+ to join.  By answering the vetting questions and attempting to join you are agreeing that you're over 18 *and* over the age of majority in your jurisdiction.**
  - **Lying about your age will result in a ban.**
- **No ethnic, racial, gender, psychological, sexual, ableist slurs or slurs of any kind.** 
- **Usernames, nicknames and profile pictures must be SFW and non-offensive.**
- **Keep language to English as it’s what can be moderated.**  
- **Dog-whistles and skirting around the rules will not be tolerated.** 

 


## **Privacy**
Being part of this group requires mutual trust. Authentic, expressive discussions make groups great, but may also be sensitive and private. **Personal information shared in the group *must* stay in the group.**

## **Dating & Flirting**
**This is not a space for dating.**  Supportive comments and compliments on people’s progress are okay, but flirting or sexual advances are *not*.  

## **No identity policing**
Everyone’s identity and experience is valid and should be respected by community members.  
- Do not gatekeep, fakeclaim, or push medicalist rhetoric. 
- Do not impose labels or push "eggclaiming" behavior.
- Do not police self-labels or insist that they are inherently discriminatory or harmful.
  * Offering label suggestions and guidance and discussing the social nuances involved is allowed.
- All diagnostic statuses, including self-diagnosis, are confidential. Do not insist on disclosure. Educated self-diagnosis is to be respected.
- We are a demographic, not a diagnosis. Restricting the Intersex label to only include anatomical variations betrays those who experience alienation, marginalization, and unique self-concept due to their body's development and will not be permitted.

## Crisis Situations
Our space is unfortunately not equipped to handle personal crisis, so discussions on extremely triggering topics such as **CW** ||Suicidal Intention/Crisis or  Non-Suicidal Self Injury Intent/Threats|| are not allowed.  If you are in crisis please reach out to a help line or local resource.

## Direct Message (DM) Roles
Direct Message roles on our members including "Closed DMs" and "Ask to DM" must be respected.  Any contact that originates on GAC and is taken privately cannot be used to harass, solicit, or otherwise disturb the other party.  Actions in private that originated from GAC can lead to moderation action on you as a member of our space.

## Mutual Aid 
GAC supports direct action and mutual aid for our community members.  To ensure safety of our members we ask that if you're in need of support directly or are signal boosting for another cause that you **contact the moderation team first** before posting these sorts of requests. Any posts that have not been cleared with the moderation team will be taken down.  People can be notified of these posts through our @Signal Boost Notifications  role.

## Partnerships & Promotions
GAC is open to partnering with related organizations that we can vouch for as explicitly supporting intersectional genital autonomy.  Again we ask that you **contact the moderation team first** to organize any promotions or partnerships.

## **Content Warnings (CW/TW) & Spoilers**
- **When talking about sensitive topics you must use content warnings and spoilers**
- Given the nature of the space there’s no need to CW brief mentions of violated genital autonomy, as the entire space would be spoilered otherwise.  
- Examples of topics that require content warnings: ||Sexual assault, Death, Drugs, Self Harm, Queerphobia, etc.||  Continued in the Acceptable Topics Guide...
- Discord Server Content Warning Tools
  * When posting links containing content or trigger warning topics on you must use < > around the link to prevent it from embedding.  
    - E.g. `<Example link>`
  * You can use two pipe symbols (|) around text to spoiler them with a trigger warning preceding them. 
    - E.g. CW  `Trigger mention ||Message with triggering topic.||`
  * You can also type '/spoiler' before a message to spoiler the entire thing.
  * For images, you can tick a box when posting from a PC or edit the image title to start with 'SPOILER_'.


# Acceptable Topics Guide
This list is by no means complete. Please remember that if you're uncertain about these or any other topics, you can always ask. Your comfort is extremely important to us; and in the end that's why these rules are in place.  


### Okay Topics

  ## NSFW Rules  
- **Porn is *not* allowed anywhere in any GAC space.**  
- Keep NSFW content in NSFW channels.  Mature topics are allowed elsewhere given the nature of the server, but only in discussion, not in embedded or uploaded media.  Medical diagrams are allowed. 
- NSFW Media shared even in NSFW channels *must* be spoilered.  Allowing users to opt-in to seeing NSFW media is to make discussion in these channels more accessible.  
- Media shared in NSFW channels that depicts states of arousal must be accompanied by reasoning such as medical or progress. 
- No downloading, linking or sharing photos without explicit permission from the person in the photo.
- Absolutely no body shaming, keep to body positivity or neutrality.
- **Absolutely no posting of any media of minors including child circumcision or intersex surgery or progress pictures of yourself before you were 18.**

## **NSFW Guidelines**
======== QUOTE ========
> 
> As it says in the rules above, talk about genitals is permitted in the SFW channels, but discussion should be kept appropriate. In this context "appropriate" means that discussion should be kept as non-sexual and medically relevant as possible.
> 
> Here are a few good practices:
> 
> Don't talk about your genitals. Instead, talk about a neutral, non embodied abstract set.
> NSFW territory: My <genital> is so sensitive on the <fun spot>, how can I make sure it stays that way on hormones?
> Safe for urologists: How can a person beginning hormone therapy ensure that sensitivity on the <sensitive spot> region of the <genital> is preserved?
> 
> Don't talk about sexual acts. Instead, talk about physical states.
> Make mods sad: I was <sex act>ing my way through <large number> of hot <gender> last night. When they had their <body part> inside/around my <body part> it hurt so bad, what do I do?
> Makes mods proud: What should someone do if they're experiencing severe pain when something is inside/around their <body part>?
> 
> Go to NSFW chat channels. Yes, we know it's not available for everyone, but there is a separation for a reason.

# Peer Support Group
The peer support group is currently running on Tuesdays at 18:00 UTC-8(PT).  

The group itinerary typically follows as: 
- Introductions which include name, pronouns, and an icebreaker question.
- Open support topics.
- Happy topic such as wins for each person in the group, and check-outs.
- A less formal 'After Party' chat for socialization and community. 
  * Anyone can join the After Party regardless if they've attended the formal group. 



## **Voice Channel Guidelines**

### __Voice Peer Support Guidelines__
All of the server rules apply as well as additional guidelines:
- Please respect each other's time and space.  
  * Make sure someone is done speaking before you start your next thought.  
    - In larger groups a hand raising system will be used, and facilitators will tally the order of topics or speakers. 
  * Be mindful of having background noise or echo and mute yourself when you’re not talking.
  * Do not stream or screenshare unrelated content.
  
- Personal information shared in the *voice* group must stay specifically in the *voice* group.  
  * This information must not be shared in text channels without explicit consent from the sharer.  
  * Only vetted members of the group are allowed to be involved in voice discussion or on camera.  
  * A private space is required.  Please wear headphones if anyone may overhear.
- Shared video must be safe for work.
- No alcohol or other drug use on camera.

### __After Party Guidelines__
All of the server rules apply as well as additional guidelines:
- With explicit consent involved you can share video showing NSFW topics such as sharing device examples. 
  * **It is *not* a space for sexual advances or virtual sex.**
- Alcohol and other drug paraphernalia are allowed as long as explicit consent is received from all parties.  


**If someone's making you uncomfortable or breaking any of the above rules don't hesitate to message an admin or moderator, open a mod mail ticket in `#mod-tickets` or notify us with @Staff on Discord.**

We're a volunteer-run organization, so please be patient with the vetting process. On average, it takes about one day for a moderator to respond to your vetting questions.

**Important:** Do not send direct messages to moderators or admins asking to be verified more quickly. Doing so will not expedite the process and may negatively impact our assessment of your suitability for the server.
