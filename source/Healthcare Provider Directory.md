notes: Obtain small blurb from providers on thoughts on genital autonomy
notes: 
---
At GAC we're very aware that not many providers are educated on or supportive of genital autonomy, intact genitals, or marginalized intersectional identities. It can be difficult to receive the care you need when fundamental rights and identities are not respected.  These are providers who have been crowd sourced as supportive of intersectional genital autonomy as well as trans, intersex and gender diverse peoples...  They've agreed to be listed here, and may or may not be accepting new patients. 

If you'd like to add a provider to this list please ask them if they consent to being listed here, to provide a few sentences on their thoughts on genital autonomy, and any other information they want to include such as: a photo, education, bio, etc.  Then contact us with their contact info, and that information on our Contact page or in one of our groups.
