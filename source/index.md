# About Genital Autonomy Collective

Genital Autonomy in short is the right to be free from any
non-consensual genital alteration surgeries as a minor or coerced
adult including [intersex] 'corrective' surgeries, male circumcision, and female
circumcision.  These are also known as intersex genital mutilation(IGM), male genital mutilation(MGM), and female genital mutilation(FGM) respectively.

The Genital Autonomy Collective is a peer network of
[support groups](https://autonomycollective.org/groups.html) and advocates for
[intersectional](https://autonomycollective.org/FAQ.html) genital autonomy.  Our main
focus is providing support and community for the intersection of
violated genital autonomy and marginalized peoples, and their
(affected) allies.

Our overarching goal is to reduce the misconception that the genital
autonomy movement is attached to manosphere and faschosphere
influences from the right-wing.  We strive to provide an entry point
for supporters of intersectional ideals to get involved in genital
autonomy advocacy.
