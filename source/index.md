<h1 class="center urgent-call">Urgent Call to Action</h1>
<h2 class="center">Intersex Plaintiff Needed Within 30 Days</h2>

**A historic opportunity to protect intersex children under the Oregon Constitution is at risk of being lost forever.**

*Hadachek v. Oregon* challenges the state‚Äôs discriminatory genital
cutting laws which protect girls but leave boys and intersex children
unprotected. This case could establish the **first-ever constitutional
protection for intersex bodily autonomy**. But there‚Äôs a catch:

**The case will be dismissed unless a qualified intersex plaintiff comes forward within the next 30 days.**

This is our only current legal pathway to challenge Oregon‚Äôs binary
and exclusionary system. Without an intersex voice, the courts will
throw out the case -- not because it lacks merit, but because the
right person hasn‚Äôt yet been heard.

## Who We Need

We urgently seek:

* **Intersex adults (under age 40)** harmed by Oregon-based procedures
* **Intersex youth** currently under threat of medical interventions, with supportive guardians
* **Intersex adults** facing Oregon-based discrimination in education, licensing, or healthcare
* **Transgender people** who have experienced penile circumcision _in Oregon_

## The Time Is Now

If you or someone you know might qualify, **please contact the legal
team today**. Help us secure justice not just for yourself, but for
all children whose rights are ignored because their bodies don‚Äôt fit a
legal checkbox.

üëâ [Reach out to the legal team](mailto:eric@intactglobal.org) or
[learn more about the case](https://autonomycollective.org/hadacheck-v-oregon.html)

**30 days. One voice. A chance to change history.**
Don‚Äôt let this moment pass in silence.

# About Genital Autonomy Collective

Genital Autonomy in short is the right to be free from any
non-consensual genital alteration surgeries as a minor or coerced
adult including [intersex] 'corrective' surgeries, male circumcision, and female
circumcision.  These are also known as intersex genital mutilation(IGM), male genital mutilation(MGM), and female genital mutilation(FGM) respectively.

[intersex]: https://interactadvocates.org/faq/

The Genital Autonomy Collective is a peer network of
[support groups](https://autonomycollective.org/groups.html) and advocates for
[intersectional](https://autonomycollective.org/faq.html) genital autonomy.  Our main
focus is providing support and community for the intersection of
violated genital autonomy and marginalized peoples, and their
(affected) allies.

Our overarching goal is to reduce the misconception that the genital
autonomy movement is attached to manosphere and faschosphere
influences from the right-wing.  We strive to provide an entry point
for supporters of intersectional ideals to get involved in genital
autonomy advocacy.
