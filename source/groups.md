These spaces were created in response to many genital autonomy spaces
not being overtly intersectional, and inclusive to marginalized
identities, and unfortunately having disproportionately prevalent
manosphere/fachosphere influence. These are spaces for people seeking
support for (violated) genital autonomy who support intersectional
ideals.

**Our communities are explicitly anti-fascist, anti-racist and
supportive of intersectional ideals and identities.** We do not view
these stances as controversial, and feel that agreement with these
positions is a necessity for being part of our communities.

**Disclaimer:** These are peer support groups, and not a replacement
for medical advice from professionals. However, we do understand that
in many parts of the world medical providers are unlikely to be
educated on these subjects.


### Genital Autonomy Collective (GAC)

The Genital Autonomy Collective is an intersectional educational &
*support* space focused on the intersection of (violated) genital
autonomy and trans, intersex and gender diverse peoples. Topics
include the harms of circumcision and how you can restore (foreskin
restoration), phimosis stretching, intersex issues, consensual adult
genital modifications, information about physically transitioning,
intactivism and adjacent subjects.

We run a weekly peer support group in the voice chat for this intersection.

This is the exclusive safe space for trans, intersex, and gender diverse peoples.
