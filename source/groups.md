These spaces were created in response to many genital autonomy spaces
not being overtly intersectional, and inclusive to marginalized
identities, and unfortunately having disproportionately prevalent
manosphere/fachosphere influence. These are spaces for people seeking
support for (violated) genital autonomy who support intersectional
ideals.

**Our communities are explicitly anti-fascist, anti-racist and
supportive of intersectional ideals and identities.** We do not view
these stances as controversial, and feel that agreement with these
positions is a necessity for being part of our communities.

All GAC spaces are private, and vetted directly by moderators.  When you join a Discord by the links below you'll be prompted to answer vetting questions, and a moderator will be with you soon.  Once you join your profile will not be visible by non-vetted users, and your membership is confidential. 

We're a volunteer-run organization, so please be patient with the vetting process. On average, it takes about one day for a moderator to respond to your vetting questions.

**Important:** Do not send direct messages to moderators or admins asking to be verified more quickly. Doing so will not expedite the process and may negatively impact our assessment of your suitability for the server.

**Disclaimer:** These are peer support groups, and not a replacement
for medical advice from professionals. However, we do understand that
in many parts of the world medical providers are unlikely to be
educated on these subjects.

**Due to the nature of the topics, you must be 18+ to join.  By answering the vetting questions and attempting to join you are agreeing that you're over 18 *and* over the age of majority in your jurisdiction.** 


### Genital Autonomy Collective (GAC)

The Genital Autonomy Collective is an intersectional educational &
*support* space focused on the intersection of (violated) genital
autonomy and trans, intersex and gender diverse peoples. Topics
include the harms of circumcision and how you can restore (foreskin
restoration), phimosis stretching, intersex issues, consensual adult
genital modifications, information about physically transitioning,
intactivism and adjacent subjects.

We run a weekly peer support group for this intersection.

**This is an exclusive safe space for trans, intersex, and gender diverse peoples(TIGD).**

### Support for Affected allies of Intersectional Genital Autonomy (SAIGA)

SAIGA is an intersectional educational & *support* space focused on the intersection of (violated) genital autonomy and marginalized intersectional identities. Topics include the harms of circumcision and how you can restore (foreskin restoration), phimosis stretching, intersex issues, consensual adult genital modifications, intactivism and adjacent subjects.   

**This is the space inclusive to cisgender, perisex, and non gender diverse peoples (anyone who is not trans, intersex, or gender diverse[TIGD]).**  If you are trans, intersex or gender diverse and would like an exclusive safe-space for TIGD peoples only, we have a sister server, the original **Genital Autonomy Collective** (GAC) above.
